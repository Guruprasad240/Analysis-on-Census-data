CREATE VIEW illiterates  as SELECT  education,count(education) as illiterates FROM census WHERE education = 'Less than 1st grade'  OR education = 'Children' GROUP BY education;
//calcutating total literates and total illiterates
CREATE VIEW detailsofeducation as SELECT * FROM (SELECT SUM(literates) as totalliterates FROM literate) a JOIN (SELECT SUM(illiterates) as totalilliterates FROM illiterates) b;
//calculating total people and keeping all in a single view(sub table)
CREATE VIEW totaldetails as SELECT sum(totalliterates+totalilliterates) as totalpeople,totalliterates,totalilliterates FROM detailsofeducation GROUP by totalliterates , totalilliterates ;
//finding the percentage
CREATE VIEW percentage as SELECT totalpeople,(totalliterates*100)/totalpeople as literatepercentage,(totalilliterates*100)/totalpeople as illiteratepercentage FROM totaldetails;


 totalpeople	 literatepercentage 	illiteratepercentage
  596523	  75.8755320415139          24.124467958486093

CREATE VIEW edumaritaldetails as SELECT * FROM (SELECT SUM(c) as educatedandmarried FROM edumarried) a JOIN (SELECT SUM(c) as educatedandunmarried FROM eduunmarried) b;
//calculating percentage
CREATE VIEW educateddetails SELECT SUM(educatedandmarried+educatedandunmarried) as totaleducated,educatedandmarried,educatedandunmarried FROM edumaritaldetails GROUP BY educatedandmarried,educatedandunmarried;
